Hi! This is the repository of a categorisation task written with JsPsych. It's an eight choice categorisation task where participants need to classify images in one of eight possible semantic categories. Images are rendered challenging under 5 possible manipulations (see [this repository](https://github.com/TimManiquet/Recurrence-stimulus-set) for the visual manipulations).

The 8 categories are:
- Bananas
- People
- Buses
- Buildings
- Fire hydrants
- Birds
- Cats
- Trees
